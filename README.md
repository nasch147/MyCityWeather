# MyCityWeather
 ## This project consited of using various python libraries, OpenWeather API, and google maps API. 
 
 Weather data was pulled by using 5,000 randomly generated longitudes and latitudes and searching for the nearest city to those coordinates. Various weather data for each city found was then consolidated into a single datafram
 
 The google API was then again used to find a lodging location for each city and added to the original dataframe. These results were then filtered by temperature ranges selected by the user. Next, a marked heatmap using maximum temperature was created complete with index boxes detailing the establishment, city, country, description of the weather, and maximum temperature. 
 
 An itinerary was then created by generating maps using various functionalities of the google maps API giving directions to each of the four locations selected and marker information for each location.
